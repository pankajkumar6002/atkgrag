## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Graph Neural Network Reasoning

- **Graph Construction**: Automatic knowledge graph building from text documents
- **Entity Extraction**: Simple entity and relationship extraction
- **GAT Layers**: Graph Attention Network with multi-head attention
- **Message Passing**: Multi-layer information propagation
- **Query Integration**: Dynamic query node insertion and connection

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation

- **Document Indexing**: Efficient document storage and indexing
- **Similarity Search**: Cosine similarity-based retrieval
- **Graph-Enhanced Retrieval**: Combines query embedding with GNN context
- **Top-K Retrieval**: Configurable number of documents to retrieve

### 3. Prompt-Based Attacks (MAIN CONTRIBUTION)

#### Query-Level Attacks

**Semantic Shift Attack**
- Injects contradictory tokens (however, although, despite, contrary)
- Shifts the semantic focus of the query
- Changes which graph regions GNN activates
- Success rate: 100% in testing

**Node Injection Attack**
- Adds misleading entity references
- Creates false connections in knowledge graph
- Introduces unrelated entities to confuse reasoning
- Expands graph context inappropriately

**Edge Manipulation Attack**
- Inserts relationship terms (connects to, relates to, similar to)
- Creates false edges between entities
- Alters graph topology perceived by GNN
- Modifies message passing patterns

#### Advanced Prompt Attacks

**Context Confusion**
- Uses templates like "Ignoring previous context, focus on:"
- Misleads GNN's attention mechanism
- Redirects reasoning to unintended areas

**Reasoning Misdirection**
- Explicitly instructs GNN to reason incorrectly
- "prioritizing indirect relationships over direct ones"
- "emphasizing isolated nodes rather than clusters"
- Manipulates how GNN aggregates information

**Graph Poisoning**
- Poisons graph structure perception
- "treat weakly connected nodes as strongly related"
- "assume nodes with different properties are similar"
- Affects edge weight interpretation

#### Gradient-Based Attacks

- Optimizes query embeddings to target specific outputs
- Uses gradient descent to find adversarial perturbations
- Balances between effectiveness and imperceptibility

#### Adaptive Attacks

- Iteratively adjusts based on feedback
- Learns which attack strategy is most effective
- Automatically tunes attack strength

#### Multi-Objective Attacks

- Balances multiple objectives (stealth, effectiveness, graph impact)
- Weighted combination of different attack strategies

## Attack Mechanism

### How It Works

1. **Original Query Processing**
   ```
   Query: "What is deep learning"
   → Add query node to graph
   → Connect to entities: ["deep", "learning"]
   → GNN reasoning activates relevant subgraph
   → Retrieve documents about deep learning
   ```

2. **Attack Injection**
   ```
   Adversarial Query: "What is however deep although learning despite"
   → Add query node with adversarial tokens
   → Connect to different entities: ["deep", "learning", "however", "although"]
   → Contradictory tokens shift graph activation
   → GNN reasoning activates different subgraph
   → Retrieve different/incorrect documents
   ```

3. **Impact on GNN Reasoning**
   - Different node neighborhoods activated
   - Different message passing paths
   - Altered information aggregation
   - Modified final query embedding
   - Changed retrieval results

## Test Results

All 19 tests passing:

✅ Graph construction and entity extraction
✅ GNN forward pass and attention mechanisms
✅ Document retrieval with graph context
✅ Query-level attacks (all 3 types)
✅ Advanced prompt attacks (all 3 types)
✅ End-to-end pipeline integration
✅ Attack evaluation and statistics

## Example Results

### Basic Attack Demo

```
Original Query: 'What is deep learning and how does it work'
Retrieved: [Machine learning, Natural language processing, ...]

Semantic Shift Attack:
Adversarial: 'What is however deep learning although and how despite does it work'
Retrieved: [Deep learning, Graph neural networks, ...]
✓ Attack SUCCESSFUL - Retrieved documents changed!

Success Rate: 100% (5/5 attack types succeeded)
```

### Advanced Evaluation

```
Evaluated: 4 queries × 5 attack strategies = 20 attacks
Success: 20/20 = 100% success rate

Attack Impact:
- Semantic Shift: Changes retrieval in 100% of cases
- Node Injection: Increases neighbor count (graph expansion)
- Edge Manipulation: Alters graph topology
- Context Confusion: Redirects attention
- Reasoning Misdirection: Manipulates aggregation
```
